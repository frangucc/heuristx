The doors opened at 6:30pm and there was a support Band, I think they were called M8 on from 7:00 till 7:45pm. The Kings of Leon actually came on stage at 8:15pm and didn't leave it until 10:45!!! I have to say they were AMAZING!!!!! I loved them so much I am going again in July!!",Body:"Nathan 29<br/>Caleb - 26<br/>Matthew - 23<br/>Jared - 22<br/>I think that's pretty much right."},{Question:"What are other good Kings of Leon songs?",Details:"",Body:"Kings of Leon is phenomenal, and I agree with all of the songs that Hallie H listed as well. However if you are into the new cd I would suggest the very last song, \"Cold Desert\". The lyrics are great and the song is beautiful. My favorite overall song is probably \"Trani\" though. That song is unreal and there are some really good videos of them playing it live on YouTube."},{Question:"How can I get my bass to sound like the bass in the song 'Crawl' by Kings Of Leon?",Details:"",Body:"A heavy distortion works great. It doesn't really matter what type of distortion, just max it pretty high. don't put the volume to high though, that just gets annoying. Also, a thunderbird helps get the tone closer. No amp change is necessary, I saw them live and he played it through his regular amp."},{Question:"Is it true Kings Of Leon are a manufactured boy band?",Details:"",Body:"completely false. They are actually all related and grew up a very religious household and just started creating music for the heck of it. They write all their own songs and taught themselves to play their instruments..."}]);

The first to bring audiences a second stage, Lollapalooza was instrumental in exposing alternative music formats to the masses – blending diverse musical styles like hip-hop and electronica with rock and roll. Lollapalooza quickly established itself as a lifestyle festival, pushing the envelope and exposing concertgoers to a subculture of ‘alternative’ living and art, and providing a platform for numerous human rights and environmental causes."},
